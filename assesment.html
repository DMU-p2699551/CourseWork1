It all starts when Matt Buckner , an american student studying journalism gets kicked out of university for a drug related crime forcing him to fly to england and move in with his sister. When he arrives in england he meets the leader of the GSE Pete Dunham, who therefore introduces him into the world of football and the old firms.
